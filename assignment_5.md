## Assignment
Choose an open source project you are using or considering to use.
Search on the Internet or in the installation of the software (GUI, CLI, documentation) 
for information related to use of the project, its community, and development. 
Find what is the project license, whether the license is approved by OSI or FSF, 
which type of license it is, how to report bugs and request new features in the project,
how to ask questions about using the project, how to contact developers,
who provides commercial support, how to get latest source code,
where to view the code online, where to get information about contributing to the project,
whether the project is active, and anything else what you think is important.
